Shoutout to John Smilga as his udemy course is that one that I followed step by step to do this project. 

Still confused by Node, I understand the processes and information but still can't do all of it on my own. 

I made another task tracker that uses, html, css, and js to add, delete, and edit tasks but only uses Node.js to host a local server. But ultimately am submitting this one as this uses a db with node. If you would like to see the other one just let me know!
